This DOC is about the "start.sh" init script that allow you to use many
functions.

Usage: start.sh --options $command $language

Starting DreamOS Emulation:"

  Usage: '$0 qemu'  -> to use Qemu Emulator
	 '$0 bochs' -> to use Bochs Emulator

be sure you have one of those, else you can try it from
floppy drive, or boot it form your grub.. DreamOS can! :) 

However you have the possibility to choose if you want to 
compile DreamOS or only lunch the 'Emulator'.
If you want to compile, use the USE Flags '--compile' then
the command, like:

  Usage: start.sh --compile $emulator
or any command you like to compile before.

Also you can chose the language for the boot message, it
can be very important to understanding the OS and do the
			 debug.

So please add the argv[3] into your option to this launch 
script, something like that:

  Usage: start.sh --compile $emulator $language

where now language supported is 'it' or 'en'
  
If you want, you can install DreamOS on your floppy
So, it's very simple, just type install in argv[1] then
your test on emulators:

  Usage: start.sh floppy_install


If you want to install DreamOS into your grub, the step
is very simple, just grub into your argv[1] :-)
Please, be sure you have python."

  Usage: start.sh grub

Please Read the HOW To Grub Script to a secure use of it.
