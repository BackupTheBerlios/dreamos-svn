Usage: ./start.sh options command language
---------------------------------------------------------------
Starting DreamOS Emulation:

Usage: ./start.sh qemu  -> to use Qemu Emulator
       ./start.sh bochs -> to use Bochs Emulator
be sure you have one of those, else you can try it from
floppy drive, or boot it form your grub.. DreamOS can! :) 

However you have the possibility to choose if you want to 
compile DreamOS or only lunch the 'Emulator'.
If you want to compile, use the USE Flags '--compile' then
the command, like:"

Usage: ./start.sh --compile emulator
or any command you like to compile before.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Also you can chose the language for the boot message, it
can be very important to understanding the OS and do the
debug.

So please add the argv[3] into your option to this launch
script, something like that:

Usage: ./start.sh --compile emulator language
where, now, language supported is 'it' or 'en'
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, you can install DreamOS on your floppy
So, it's very simple, just type install in argv[1] then
your test on emulators:"

Usage: ./start.sh floppy_install
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to install DreamOS into your grub, the step
is very simple, just grub into your argv[1] :-)
Please, be sure you have python."

Usage: ./start.sh grub
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, you can create a DreamOS ISO Image Disk
to burn it on a cdrom and boot it from a real PC.
Make sure you have installed mkisofs from cdrkit package.
The command is like this:

Usage: ./start.sh create_iso
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, you can create a DreamOS FileSystem
You know, this is *VERY* important :)
To add the file and then re-create the FS, put you files
into files/ and do:

Usage: ./start.sh create_fs

Also you should know that this process is maked during the
compilation of DreamOS.
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, you can create a DreamOS Floppy ISO Image
to burn it on a cdrom and boot it from a real PC.
Make sure you have installed genisoimage from cdrkit package.

Usage: ./start.sh eltorito_iso
---------------------------------------------------------------
